# KobWeb
This project was created for a university course with 6 other member. 

It is a social media app (Instagram clone), where registered users can upload post, that can contain text, pictures and gifs.
They can also search for people registered, add friends to their list, like and leave comments to their posts.
There are admin users too. They can ban users from using the website.
There is also a randomized advertisement system that can either show a vertical, a horizontal or no ad at all.

## Technical details
The project was developed in Angular 14. It uses Google Firebase as the database and hosting provider. We used Angular Material and Angular Flex Layout for designing the frontend.

## My contribution
In the project, I:
- Designed the layout of the app, handled routing tasks and created the navbar/sidebar.
- Developed the following pages in the website: Post, Profile.
- Implemented the following logic: Posting, Advertisements, Picture uploading (Posts and Register), Lazy loading on the Feed/Profile.
- Optimized subscriptions to observables, because we had multiple issues with running out of the free quota in Firebase.
- Did numerous ui bugfixes throughout the developement of the app.
